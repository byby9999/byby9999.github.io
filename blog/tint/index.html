Interviews are a highly stressful situation for most of us. For this reason, I found along my experience a set of useful perspectives and ideas, that can hopefully help you to better see things as how they are.

With this arsenal of knowledge, I hope you'll get more courage for the next time you step into the meeting where you will be questioned, inquired and asked to justify every step of your whole professional journey.

It's a conversation, not a monologue. You have the chance to also ask your own questions, and put out your own curiosities. Don't solely rely on their part to lead the whole conversation, please avoid assuming the role of a follower. You have the right to speak, and I even think that with the right amount of speaking, you will impress as a person who takes initiative. It is not enough to just stay put, quiet and listen. It is also your chance to find out more about them, not just the other way. Of course, it will not hurt to do a bit of homework, beforehand. Though they are not human beings, companies can get flattered. And it happens throung the people representing it. It will create a good impression to know a bit about the company's domain of work, industry, and maybe even some high-level figures. For example: a rounded up number of employees in the country of your potential hiring, if it is multi-national - the top 2-3 cities where they hold offices, the name of the CEO, things like that. These details can be used not just to show off, but also they are a good conversation lubricant. It shows basic respect, it grows the opportunity to evolve to more complex, detailed questions, if a good base is obviously well covered. And beyond the purpose of impressing the people, I recommend that from a more pragmatic perspective, as it is the kind of information that helps you personally, too. It might make the difference between choosing one company over another. We have in Romania this site called undelucram. It is an unique platform, offering insights from most major employers on national level. Helped by tools like this, along with other websites that can offer you financial situations for companies, you can compile a very detailed image about how a certain company operates, you can tell whether it is being managed fairly, you can analyze its growth throughout time. This is decisive information, I think it helps you know more about the company than any PR representative can do.

Only mention projects and technologies from your history that you are happy to expand on. I have seen it too many times, and I have also done it too many times. In the wish to seem cultured and experienced, people enumerate so many items as their own skills, that it can be overwhelming. Please keep in mind a very important point - on some topics, you MIGHT be asked for more details. So please refrain from throwing too loosely a cascade of acronyms and skills, just in the hope you will not be dissected about them. The Hows, whens, wheres might throw you off in some cases. And it's unpleasant to have awkward silences during the interview. Preferably, you would have a well structured answer, or at least one that can be expressed passionately. You don't want to seem bitter, pessimist or stumbling. Too often I've been in this situation when this line of question purely blocks me. Without getting super-technical, I cannot go and further detail my experience with one certain thing. Not without seemiing a bit grumpy. Whether I hated that specific tech, whether I hated the project or the team from that context, it would be nice to not let this reflect on my answers to some innocent people. But I failed. And people notice tone very easily. If you associate in any way, any tech or project with a bad experience, better wipe it from the written CV or from any verbal mentionings. If for whatever reason, there is experience in your history for which you would rather not get more questions, better not present it in the first place. Or, if you prefer it present, keep in mind to prepare in advance some possible lines of answers for that certain topic.

Try putting something in terms of "how I overcame X challenge". People love success stories. They love hearing about a challenge being overcome. A problem being solved. A conflict being difused. An obstacle being "jumped". If let's say you ignore the idea from above and decide to share a negative situation from your experience, try framing it into this narrative of challenge-overcoming, problem-solution pair. It is an archetype of a story that we all love, regardless of domain. HR has made some updates in their repertoir of classical interview questions, trying to keep up with the times. And often, they will in one way or another include this kind of question anyway, so it does not hurt to have the story prepared. "how you overcame a difficult situation" is a pretty frequent HR question nowadays, of course with varying formulations, but pointing to the same direction. You surely have in mind many ideas about how something could go wrong. Just add some twist of a resolution to that situation. It can even be a minor situation, it does not matter that much how details go around, it's important to keep the structure of problem-solution, however small it might be.

Ask about growth opportunities. Not just to prove something, but for your own benefit. It helps to have an overview of what are your future opportunities in that company. The sooner you know them, the easier to make better decisions. Some people look for growth towards management. Others might look for growth in a more technical area, since we're talking about developers and IT generally, in here. And to each its own, there's no right or wrong approach on this. Discovering your personal preference is part of the professional path, and it might take years, and that is perfectly fine. There was a time when the classical list of interview questions included that passe one of "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?". Luckily, HR learned throughout time that not all of those questions made sense, and they updated the classical list. We see it today as a silly question to be asked in interviews, since the dynamism of the market is metaphorically "insane", and an accurate prediction of what will happen in 5 years is closer and closer to imposible. But deep down, job interviews aside, on a personal level, I still believe each individual should have a reasonable plan for their next...X years, be they 3, 5, or as many as they can. Sure, the individual can only control this much. There's little they can do, in a globally influenced world, but for the things that can be achieved on that personal level, I believe it is worth to try. So in conclusion, worth trying to reverse the roles and this time you be the one who asks them - "where do you see me, within the company, in 5 years?"
