I took a class on Data Science & ML. Since I successfully finished and I'm very enthusiastic about the subject, I would like to share the story of how it went.

Stage 1 - Terms and Tools

This first step was about the basics. The terms, the concepts and the tools that will be used for the course. Sometimes I dug even deeper, taking separate time to get to search something more in-depth, since the course is covering just the basics. Here I found out about some very useful things in Google's toolset, that helped me skip installing some more software on my machine. I could run the code in a cloud platform and be free.

Equally important, the terms part is also a considerable chapter. Even if the subject is often marketed with words like "coding" or "programming", it is quite a paradigm shift, when compared to what a regular programmer does day to day (unless they're already in Data Science/ML). You need to understand the terms well. Once you do, this helps you regardless of the ML framework you'll get to. The Data Science community is well organized and consistent on vocabulary use. I got the chance to see small implementations of ML in both Python and .NET, and I'm happy to announce the foundational terms are being kept consistent in both frameworks. So changing tools should not be a big problem if you get the base concepts.

Stage 2 - Flashbacks from Statistics & Probabilities class

If you were like me and had the chance to take a Probabilities & Statistics course in faculty, chances are some of the words in Data Science courses will not be new to you. Problem is at that time, I did not have the luck to be taught by a passionate or very involved teacher. For this reason, at that point I hated the subject and I did not understand its potential. Recalling it sparked a bitter taste, as passing the final exam was a real pain. But after all, the familiarity of some terms was a comfortable thing.

What I mean here, in short, is that it helps to be prepared with some basic probabilities and/or statistics concepts. Very basic level, nothing too fancy. This domain might seem as sparlking fresh or modern, but the more you look deep into its core, the more you discover its built on the strong, mature pillars of statistics - that centuries-old, probably unsexy-sounding science.

Stage 3 - Completing the Project

This was the next checkpoint reached on the journey. In this step, I finished the practical project. It felt good to have a practical proof of everything learned. It is a computer vision program, aimed to detect dog breeds from photos. It was built using Google's colab notebooks, some tool that can run Python in the cloud. This is that point on a road where you can stop, reflect and be proud of everything accomplished! At this point, it's advisable to brag and dance around the office too, if that's your celebration style. Keeping the notebooks and the final project will surely help me in any potential projects in the future.

Step 4 - What Now?

At this step, it's the ideal time to wonder where should I go next. And just like any other philosophical-sounding question, I don't have a very clear answer to it. But I am sure it was an enriching experience, that rounded up my skillset and made me a more versatile software developer. By now, I think would be able to integrate small data science/ML features into larger products, that are not ML/DS-centered. I have an idea about the general path, how to start and the most used tools in the trade. Surely, I don't know by heart every single step of the way, but lots of these can be figured out as you go. I think this course's best benefit is that it offered me confidence. First, confidence about starting a ML-related project. And second, confidence to have conversations about ML with other developers, without feeling like 'I have no idea'.

P.S. not that I'm sponsored or something, but I honestly recommend the course. Language is clear, instructors are empathetic and content is well-thought to keep your attention on it.
