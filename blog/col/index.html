Database collation tells the engine how to act about storing the characters, in accordance with the language and regional specifics of the user. It not only influences the ability to store certain characters in your strings, but it is related to many other settings, which will impact the way the db engine will do some actions behind the scenes. Collation would need at leat a bit of consideration from any programmer's attention, as it is strongly linked to some operations that we consider as "default" and we usually take for granted. But it is very easy to omit knowing what happens behind the scenes. So we often leave alone some settings that are configurable, going on assumptions pushed by certain standard practices. When a non-standard operation, with possibly non-standard data will appear - problem. We better be prepared, since it might break our initial assumptions about our DB systems. Collation is one of those kinds of concepts - easily ignored, but capable of producing difficult situations and confusion.

On an abstract, conceptual level, collations can be seen as some idea a bit above encodings. While encodings tell you HOW to interpret a certain set of characters from a file, collations rather define the WHAT - what character set is allowed to be used in a certain place.

An example of a collation is: 'Tibetan_100_CI_AI_KS_WS_SC'. As you can see, it is formed by more components, separated by a dash. CS is for Case Sensitive, AS comes from Accent Sensitive, KS - Kanatype Sensitive (a type of character in Asian languages), WS stands for width-sensitive, SC - supplementary characters. All of these parts being abbreviations that tell us something about what kinds of characters are supported by this collation.

Where will you see effects of a collation?

In sorting for example - for the case of Accent Sensitive character sets, you might have interesting results on languages that support certain letters both with and without accent(s). Take French for (hopefully) an easily accessible example. Let's take three random words, all starting with same 'e' letter but existing in many formulas for without accent or with 2 kinds of accents: é__, è__, and e__. If collation is set to accent sensitive, sorting mechanism will order these three words in a quite interesting way. If collation is set to be sensitive (or not) to upper-case/lower-case, again, this influences sorting. If collation is not set right as to support the French language, you might not even be able to store those accented characters in the db, in the first place. So it's quite important to figure out as early as possible the collation needed for your data storage needs. For SQL server specifically, the solution for supporting French characters is to set the collation to Latin1_General, but for other specific cases you will need to do your own research.

Plus, you might not get access to your favorite language's characters if using the wrong collation. E.g. my native Romanian language, though of Latin descent, has some special, weird little accents for some letters, for example: ă,î. We call them "little hats" on the normal letters. I am able to write them here with ease because I previously set this page's character set to utf-8, which includes Ro language set, and that is a pretty easy operation to do on HTML-level. But collation is a term rather referring to database character sets. So in SQL Server I would need some quite different steps to set a collation that allows me to store characters like the ones with little hats.
