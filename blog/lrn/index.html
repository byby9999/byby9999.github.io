Hey, how's it going? If you are into tech or you are interested in IT/tech-related topics, I think that by now, you understand the importance of keeping our skills up to date. The IT market moves with rocket speed, and it is important to keep up with the pace, if you decide to become a professional in the industry. Needless to say, nowadays it is even more chaotic and fast-evolving than usual, considering the unprecedented times. Anyways, I came here today, in this sunny Sunday, to present you a short side-by-side comparison of the most popular learning platforms you can find online. Since I believe strongly in education and in self-taught skills, hopefully this article will help you for your next decision about where to start a new course. Since I'm in the software industry for about 6 years, this is the official disclaimer - my opinion could be biased from this point of view. Most of the content I accessed on all these platforms is related to IT/software. Please do not consider that all content on the platforms will be the same as the things I found for my specific needs.

Udemy - this is a very good platform for newbies into e-learning. The stakes are usually low, I'd say. So this platform makes it easy to start your way into e-learning, to get more familiar with this kind of training, if you are not sure yet whether this content format really fits your style. While browsing through Udemy, I found all sorts of classes, even though my focus was on software things. Besides IT, I also found interesting side-themes like cooking, music creation, personal develompent and management skills, and the list surely goes on...

By "low stakes" I meant that prices are pretty low, so it's quite hard to have a buyer's remorse feeling, in case the course is not what you expected. Prices range usually from 10-15 eur, and personally I think it is a small price for a new, valuable skill to acquire.

Plus, it's not like you are FIRST throwing money out the window and THEN you'll see what sticks. The platform is very well organised around reviews for the course, and for instructors. Most trainers also include some free samples of the content, to make a high-level idea about how they will teach. You can make a pretty good idea about what a course will entail, just from the reviews and the free, preview-style information

Most trainers depend on your feedback, as a student, to know how to improve. This is why a lot of trainers will ask you, repetitively, on Udemy, to rate them. Preferably you'd need to follow a more consistent part of their content before reviewing, but that is up to you, of course. The platform also insists pretty often with asking for your review. Sometimes it even asks you after the first, 1-minute introductory video, which might be a pretty silly thing to do. It is hard to form an opinion right after a short part of the whole product. Especially when that is practically more close to the sales pitch than to some educational content. But I suggest to be patient and understand that the platform is just asking you this because that's how it was programmed, it is nothing personal. You have some "skip" buttons available anytime. Look for that hard to see button called 'ask me at the end of the course'. This way, they will leave you in peace to learn.

Features: Learning paths, CC (subtitles - added by trainer), Video speed (0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, 2x), Add notes - linked with fixed point in video, Q&A page, Resources - attachable per video, Certificate upon course completion

Pluralsight - This is a platform with a very well established name in the e-learning industry, and I think it is amongst the first platforms of its kind. Going by info from wikipedia, it was founded in 2004, and none of the other companies in this list can brag about such an early start.

Pluralsight is more openly dedicated to software developers, mentioning these key words among their headlines and presentations. So while you may find a lack of diversity in content categories (in comparison with Udemy for example), you could benefit from this more software-focused aspect if you find yourself in an IT-related position. Having this stronger focus on software helps you find educational content on more niche frameworks, rare libraries & languages, or very specific business cases. Just a quick browse among the most general categories, enumerates the following, at the time of writing: Business Professional, Cloud, Data & Machine Learning, IT Ops, Security, Software Development. Personal note - they are not as feedback & review-centered as Udemy. Which might be good, Udemy asks you after first few minutes for reviews, a thing that might not be a really fair thing to do. Pluralsight seems to be more relaxed in that matter. Don't get me wrong, there's still a place where you can review a course, it's just well placed and not

I followed a few courses on this platform, and as a personal note, I find it as the most professional, the best organised platform of all. Content is focused on quality, conveying information in the simplest ways possible - clear font, good diagrams, high-quality videos. Content is well split - videos with heavy information are "cut" into small pieces, making info easier to digest. Trainers are well-established professionals, with easily accessible track records of their amazing work. My impression is that not anyone could teach on Pluralsight. The appearance of content, I suspect it is standardized in some aspects. All courses seem to use same font, same sets of colors on diagrams, some standard style for lists, and so on. If this is good or not, remains up to debate. But I can see a benefit in this. No matter how many classes I browse, information will be presented in a quite similar way, and I can find comfort in this, plus I believe it helps with accessibility. I don't mind the potential loss in creativity, as long as the elements are well chosen.

Their business model is quite different from Udemy. Pluralsight is a subscription-based platform, unlike Udemy, where the model is around pay-per-unit consumed. Pluralsight support both personal and teams licences too, so if you can, work the courage to go to your boss and ask them to offer company-level Pluralsight subscriptions for all employees. For IT-based companies, this would add great value. Otherwise, I admit, it might be considered a bit on the expensive side, as the personal subscription starts at 29$/month, up to 45$ for Premium. But if you find yourself at a moment when you want education to be a big slice of your life, I believe the investment is worth it. The 10 free trial days might also help with taking the decision.

Features: Paths, Channels (community feature), Bookmarks (notes attached to fix point in video), CC, video Speed (more granularly editable - steps of 0.1 selectable from range: 0.5x to 2x)

LinkedIn Learning - This is a feature that I suspect is pretty unknown to the majority, even though it belongs to LinkedIn, a company that by now is pretty popular as a social platform. With its unique niche of "professional", LinkedIn distinguishes itself among the other social networks that are more general-purpose tools, or rather prefer to not say their main purpose. Anyways, LinkedIn Learning is a feature that belongs to the paid area of LinkedIn, probably that is why it is not so well known. I would suspect most LinkedIn users keep their business in the free zone. Similarly to platforms above, LinkedIn Learning could be seen like an online university.

Content of courses is of very high quality, and the recommendation system works like a charm - if you completed correctly your LinkedIn profile, with all skills and education, LI does a very good job in suggesting the right courses for you - for gaining skills in areas that are related to current skills, and that make sense. Plus - trainers have an easily accessible track record, usually being linked with their own LI profile on course. So verifying credentials and gaining trust in an instructor is easier than in any other place, I'd say.

By my limited browsing and by the 2 classes I followed, I noticed another advantage - some courses are rather short. Not short as in "they miss key information", but rather concise - well concentrated info, well curated. You can find courses that total to 2h, or 4h. For niche subjects, this can be enough time to cover everything that is essential. Isn't it a comforting thought to think - "I can start it and finish it in the same day"? I believe it is quite nice. All have certifications of completion that can be attached to the personal profile. Content themes range from personal and managerial aspects to quite technical niches - from Agile, leadership and motivation, up to Linux, ML.NET and optimizing SQL Server databases, there's something for everyone.

One essential benefit - it integrates very well in the whole LinkedIn ecosystem. If you follow their courses, it is worth to also maintain a LinkedIn profile, to showcase your freshly earned skills and badges. This improves your discoverability and adds value to your profile. The LinkedIn algorithms behind that "searching" done by recruiters will always promote people that continuously use the features offered by the platform - be they "courses", "skills", "endorsments", "badges", "recommendations" and so on. This could potentially give you an upper hand in a recruitment process.

It is quite hard to speak about the financial aspect since with LI I find it more intricate. It might take too long to browse through all courses and see how they can be bought. But generally, what I found about LinkedIn is the following: you have to have Linkedin Premium (paid) subscription to access any course. This subscription comes also with some extra features on the social network, but we'll leave them for another time, since this is focused on e-learning. So once you have Premium, some courses are accessible for free. Others - not very sure, might need extra costs. The Premium, depending on where I search, varies as price - now, in Romania it seems to start at 111 RON/month, and if I google in english, seems to be 29$/month, so pretty similar. But besides that, if you don't care much about social network side, ignore Premium, courses can also be bought individually (pay per unit, Udemy-style). Their free, preview-kind of info is less than what's on the other platforms, so I personally feel that on this one, investments might be a bit more risky. You can easier track trainers, but you don't have much video content to preview - very short, general videos that might not be enough to form an impression. Courses price varies, it is not universal, and each course requires 1-2 clicks for its price to be shown. As an example - I simulated the flow of buying one ML.NET course I'm interested in, up to the payment step, and it seems to cost in total 155RON (vat included), so slightly above the monthly cost of the subscription. It's up to you to say whether this is a good deal or not. I'm not particularly ready for that purchase right now.

Features: I can't access platform at the moment, and I am not willing to pay for accessing it anymore. So in fairness I will prefer to mark this with a "don't know". I remember though that videos had a very good quality, always available on the latest quality setting - be it 720p, 1080p and so on.

MS Docs and MS Learn platform - Lastly, I chose to add a suite of free platforms, for diversity :). Since this is a very good and useful resource for people interested into learning more about the technical aspects of the Microsoft-provided technologies, such as VB, C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, SQL server, EF and many more. Here you can see how Microsoft has put in quite immense efforts to document all of their internal products, offering as detailed info as possible for all its community members. Some days I still find myself sifting through the MS docs for the day to day needs on the job. Since I am a software developer with the Microsoft technologies, I think it is sometimes the most convenient to go right to the source for clear information. Who else knows more about a technology, if not their own creators?

For MS docs, I would congratulate Microsoft for the way they changed the style of organising all that big repository of information. In case you might not know, documentations are often quite voluminous things. If they were to be printed, they would probably take full walls of books, maybe even cover the windows (haha, get it?, pun intended). So even in the digital world, they still need to be well organised and sorted, to be easy to access. MS deserves a little crown for adding great features that improve accessibility on their docs - the tree-like structure from left panels helps us build the familiarity of the file explorers, into the web. The breadcrumbs, making it easy to navigate back to the path you walked up to now. The split of articles into regions, to which you can link directly, by clicking on their title. The split window, in which you can write code and run it live, in-browser, to test how certain methods act up. The examples, all is well shown.

Ok, that covered MS Docs. Now - the more attractive half of this point, MS Learning platform. I think this is the one previously called Microsoft Virtual Academy (not sure), but I've been a faithful user of MVA, and a pretty new but enthusiastic user of MS Learn. If the MS Docs are rather focused on textual information, you would be happy to find out that MS Learn is more friendly to the visual learners, combining textual info with very nice, concise and easy to understand video content. A great feature is the very clear learning paths (well tailored for your custom career plans), they have good reviews and mention beforehand how much time a certain unit would take to be finished. All the experience is built with a flavor of gamification - you earn XP points and badges as you prorgress. Trainers are mostly MS employees, expert users or even creators of the said technologies, so the quality is nothing to worry about.

Being a free resource, the sky is the limit. For some skills, you can also confirm your acquired knowledge by taking one of the official, paid, MS certificate exams. Some communities and companies might require them, some might be impressed by them, but at the end of the day they are optional.

Just one drawback with these 2 sister-platforms: they are focused on MS-related tech. Understandable from certain points of view, I still can't help but wish sometimes that I could access info about other tech outside the MS universe, presented in a similar manner as MS. Lots of competing technologies have a common concept, but explained and implemented with different terms by each company, and sometimes skill conversion from one to another is harder than it could be, for this exact reason. Each company aims to centralize its own info, to focus on itself, avoiding to draw parallels with competitors options. For example: if you want to learn about cloud, MS can only present you things about their solution provider - Azure. Yes, it is great quality info, but you would not know what other options are available - such as Google's or Amazon's solutions. It is your own duty to do the research for this.

Features: Learning Paths, (best implementation of all, in my opinion), Bookmarks, call-to-action (sections where you are invited to write and run code), progress tracking, gamification - makes engagement more pleasant
