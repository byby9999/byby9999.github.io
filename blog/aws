Among my personal development points for this year, there is a big, flashy entry about AWS. It used to be on the first place. The goal is simple - earn the Developer Associate certification, otherwise called DVA-C01. But as time went by and study went on a quite slow rhythm, I decided to postpone this goal for the next year, the holy 2023. So why did I do it?

After trying this video course on Udemy and trying out different practice tests, I realised that what I did was just passive listening, not very active learning. I waited for the course videos to pass, just to be able to mark them as "checked". I saw this learning experience as a checklist, and I got too much into the box-checking, forgetting the real objective. The content just flew by, and I memorised very little of it. Not that the trainer is bad, but the information is very dense, especially for a newbie to cloud, networking and so on. This is a very comprehensive course, presenting ALL of AWS's services. Which are pretty numerous. Each service requires deep understanding and dedicated time to learn. The trainer just covers the surface of each, but even this scratching off the surface sometimes feels as too much.

Also, it's pretty hard to focus on things you have never met in practice. Some concepts are explained just with diagrams, which is a bit abstract and over-simplifying. For anyone who knows how technical matters can cause problems, you might relate to this idea that diagrams tend to oversimplify, and do not take into account potential errors, research and learning time, etc. Diagrams are simple and easy, but practice sometimes hits off a million errors that slow down project development.

I also decided to postpone it because of my (lack of) experience. I am new to AWS and cloud in general. So I consider to not have enough practice or enough professional tasks done in the AWS ecosystem, to feel comfortable about it. I would like to wait one more year, because I am confident my current position will raise different AWS challenges, so one more year of professional practice will surely help. Plus, I think that my choice is compatible with AWS's recommendations. According to their page - "AWS Certified Developer â€“ Associate is intended for anyone with one or more years of hands-on experience developing and maintaining an AWS-based application". Since this is my first year of working with AWS, I think it's fair to wait for a whole year of practice to pass. I will get more knowledge, and therefore more comfort with AWS, during this year.

This is one of the first exams where I admit I need less theory, and more practice. And although it's not generally the case, in this exam I feel like practice has a way bigger weight than theory, on the overall preparation process. Another reason for postponing is a rather personal one - I would hate to go to the exam and fail it. I take failure very personally, and it would take a long time to recover from this. So I prefer to take all the time needed, and have an enjoyable learning path. And this path can be as long as it needs to be.

Conclusion? I don't have a very clear one, just that I need more time to practice, and it's not ok to rush things. I don't want to force this exam. It is not a mandatory exam, there's no pressure from anyone to take it. It is just an exam for my own proof of expertise. So I can dedicate as much time as I want to it. And I can decide to take it whenever I feel ready. I chose to take a no-pressure approach. I'll be ready when I'll be ready.
