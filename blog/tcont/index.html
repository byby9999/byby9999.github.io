I have continued my collaboration with a learning platform. Their goal is to help people learn new IT skills, focusing on the skills with highest demands on market, in the present. Their objective is to help people become great junior IT professionals. My contribution here is linked to the C#/.NET course. What I do is create the technical content to present the foundations of C#, including topics such as OOP, delegates, exceptions, clean code, web development, testing and more. I create video content, also moderating and providing written feedback on the discussions forum attached to the course, and I host online meetups and individual coaching sessions on the same topic. After more than one year of doing such a complex course, I decided to continue and start creating content for a new course. So here's what I learned through my experience so far, some useful tips I am now appplying to the new content and it is bringing visible improvements.

Technical accuracy. A typo could be easily neglected by people in a technical course. But it is a great responsability about the correctness of the technical info. Leading people to understand a concept in a wrong way can do more harm than leaving them to simply not know about that concept.

Try and be version-neutral. Apply a sort of neutrality to the language and code used. If for example you demonstrate some code that makes use of a feature available only in more advanced versions of that language, you risk leaving people with previous versions in the dark. But at the same time, some things stayed the same from the beginnings, from version 1 up to version 10, for example. Try giving code examples that could easily be taken from a PC with version 10, pasted to one with version 3, and still work without much effort on modifications. If one thing is available to 90% of your public and the newer thing is available to only 60% of them, choose the one with 90%, even if it is a bit older in the technical context. In educational materials, accessibility is more important than keeping pace with newest things.

Prefer verbose and self-explanatory code over short and cryptic. We as programmers love to find shortcuts, to type less, always less and less, if possible. But we forget that behind those short, hacky constructions lie some very complex concepts that we might know naturally. Newbies do not have this privilege to want to write less. They want to first understand it. Only then, if possible, find out how it can be written in less code. Here, the best example I can think of is the ternary operator (in C# is the one with ?:, the shorter way to do a if/else-based assignment). I don't recommend presenting that operator until you present the concept of conditionals, themselves. The if/else block needs to be known BEFORE any occurence of the ternary operator. Because that's exactly it's purpose - to be a shorter version of if/else. To understand it, you'd rather first understand the if/else construction. Which leads me to the next...

Build progressively. If you need to learn T1, but T1 requires you to know T0, then for sure start with T0 first, then do T1. Knowledge works very similarly to bricks. The base ones need to be put first. The top ones can only exist if they are placed on the solid, foundation ones from before.

Language. Simple enough to convey the idea with familiar terms. Not over simplified to the point people make the wrong connections.

When written text is not enough...I usually also add a sample of code and describe how it would work. Sometimes just the words on a screen do not perfectly depict what you intent to say. And since we're talking about tech content, these are ideal cases to bring something better - proof. Practical code examples speak for themselves, very often.

Solidify. Bring up topics from previous sessions. Sometimes they are naturally linked to the subject, so it's easy. Other times, when it is not, it won't hurt to mention it in a "quick recap" way, without filling much time. If the concept is organically important to the current topic, it helps to also add references to where in the past lessons they can find more about that related topic.

Explain non-mouse commands. Verbally say what you are doing which involves the keyboard. Video content users cannot see your keys, unless you add some special recording features. I fell into the trap of doing fast copy-paste commands, or other IDE shortcuts I did not explain. People got a bit weird about it, since on their side it looked like magic :). Lead them along, if possible try doing the equivalent commands with the mouse (e.g. the right click copy/paste), or if not, at least add visual cues on the video with what you are doing, or even better - visual cues + verbally describing what command you do.

Analogies, everywhre. This is a topic dear to my heart, since I love finding analogies from real life to explain concepts. I look for easy to relate to things or situations. I hope they help, the general feeling is that people appreciate them. Since IT is pretty abstract in itself, trying to get out of the very-tech focused box with talking about cars, fruits and TV shows seems a bit refreshing, I hope.

Phrase things in terms of: Question-Answer. It's simple. Try and put yourself in the listener's place. Imagine them thinking "what is this, now?". Then try to expose exactly that, and address it. Or you can apply this to many other cases. When it comes to presenting a new way to do something, try starting with a question. Something like "what benefit does this bring?". Then answer it.

Relatable. Find natural examples in the real world that fit or use a certain concept. Give examples of tools and technology they themselves might use, that works with those concepts you are about to introduce. And give details on how. e.g. - the topic of a "transaction" is very easy to convey with a bank account payment.

Recap, periodically. It helps to solidify knowledge. It also helps in feeling accomplished for doing one more "check" on an item from the list. This is most naturally done at the end of one unit. But it can be split even more granularly, after each sub-section of a unit, if you think it's a good case.

Challenge students. If you find it appropriate, try adding a 2-3 questions quiz at the end of a unit. Maybe occasionally throw in a practical exercise, too. Make sure to somehow include the correct answers too, since these intermediary checks are only for self evaluation. They should test the essence of that lesson - what were the main topics. I feel like they should check that you paid attention to the content. If there's any final evaluation, that is where things would get to be a bit more difficult.
